# nb_tan

Clone the directory in your local PC and open the folder cloned in any text editors(vscode)

In the next step run the following the commands in the terminal :

python bayes.py <train-set-file> <test-set-file> <n|t>

1)python bayes.py vote_train.arff vote_test.arff n 

2)python bayes.py vote_train.arff vote_test.arff t

The above two commands will take vote_train.arff as training data, vote_test.arff as test dataset and n t will determine naive bayes and TAN respectively.
